# FetchCodingAssessment

This application calculates pixel coordinate values for an image that is to be displayed on a two dimensional surface given the dimensions of the image and the corner points of the image as it is to be displayed.

This is a flask app that accepts a JSON body at `http://localhost:5000/classify`. Expects two arguments named `dimensions` and `points` in the JSON body. 

Example request body:

```
{
    "dimensions":[3,3],
    "points":[[1, 1], [3, 1], [1, 3], [3, 3]]
}
```

### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter notebook with examples and plots](https://carriestienen.github.io/FetchCodingAssessment/)

This jupyter notebooks shows several examples with different dimensions and image coordinates. The examples are also plotted for viewing simplicity.

### Github Actions

Linting and unit testing done using Github actions. The jupyter notebook is also hosted in github actions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
